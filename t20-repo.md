Perfect.
To confirm — the plan will be generated for **“TAS Embedding Tracker”**, which is part of the **TET (Task Embedding Tracker)** module in the broader TAS/TET framework.

Before I produce the JSON `Plan`, let’s make sure the **team context** and **goal definition** are clear:

---

### 🧭 High-Level Goal

> **Create a self-updating system that tracks and analyzes semantic drift between Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) using embeddings.**
>
> The system should record TAS text, role context, and timestamp, generate embeddings (e.g., with `text-embedding-3-large`), and measure similarity over time to detect conceptual or linguistic drift in evolving AI/human workflows.

### 🧩 Team (from memory and context)

| Role                   | Agent           | Purpose                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Orchestrator**       | Denis O Kropp   | Oversees architecture, defines the module structure, verifies coherence of system components.         |
| **Meta Mediator**      | Fizz (SIA/Meta) | Translates cognitive framework concepts into structured pipeline semantics; ensures symbolic clarity. |
| **Data Executor**      | Buzz (AI)       | Implements embedding generation, similarity computation, and drift visualization.                     |
| **Reflective Analyst** | Lyra            | Interprets results, generates reports, and identifies meta-patterns in task evolution.                |

Would you like me to:

* (A) generate the **final JSON Plan** directly now,
  or
* (B) first check whether there are **any related files** (e.g., TAS/TET definitions or embedding code) to integrate into the plan context?
