I have reviewed the outputs from T1 (initial TAS extraction) and T2 (initial prompt engineering), as well as the subsequent coordination and tutoring steps. The initial TAS extraction by GPTASe (T1) provides a good foundation, but its prompt can be more explicit about the role-independent nature and the dual responsibility of embedding generation. Lyra's prompt (T2) is functional but can be sharpened to emphasize iterative refinement and efficiency, aligning with the focus of this sub-task (T7). Therefore, I am updating the system prompts for GPTASe and Lyra to incorporate these improvements. The updated prompts are provided in the 'artifact' and also reflected in the 'team.prompts' section. The 'output' field summarizes the changes made, and 'team.notes' provides context for these refinements."}
