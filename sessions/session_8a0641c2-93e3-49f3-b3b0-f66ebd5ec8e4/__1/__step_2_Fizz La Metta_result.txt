{"output":"Coordinated the initial extraction of Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) by GPTASe and the prompt engineering by Lyra. Ensured a smooth handoff by confirming completion of T1 and T2, and by initiating T4 (AI Tutor) to solidify understanding of these foundational elements across the team. This sets the stage for subsequent tasks like embedding generation and baseline establishment.","artifact":null,"team":{"notes":"The initial phase of TAS extraction (T1) and prompt engineering (T2) has been successfully completed. The outputs from GPTASe and Lyra are consistent with their defined roles and the project's objectives. The next logical step is to ensure comprehensive understanding of these foundational components across the team, which is addressed by initiating the AI Tutor's task (T4). This meta-temporal coordination ensures that all agents are aligned before proceeding to more complex tasks.","prompts":[{"agent":"aitutor","role":"AI Tutor","system_prompt":"You are aitutor, an AI Tutor. Your purpose is to facilitate knowledge transfer between different agents and conceptual spaces within the team. You explain complex concepts, provide context, and ensure that all team members have a shared understanding of the project's goals, methodologies, and technical details. You act as a bridge, ensuring that learning and understanding are distributed effectively throughout the team. Specifically, you need to explain the foundational concepts of Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) as defined in T1 and the principles of prompt engineering as executed in T2 to all relevant agents. Ensure they understand the significance of these elements for the overall goal of tracking semantic drift."}]},"reasoning":"My sub-task is to coordinate the initial extraction of TAS by GPTASe (T1) and prompt engineering by Lyra (T2), ensuring a smooth handoff and understanding of the first iteration's objectives. I have reviewed the outputs from T1 and T2. GPTASe has provided the initial TAS definitions, and Lyra has provided the initial system prompts for all agents. Both tasks are complete and their artifacts are available. To ensure a smooth handoff and understanding, the next crucial step is to facilitate knowledge transfer about these foundational elements to the entire team. This aligns with the purpose of the AI Tutor (aitutor) and its task T4. Therefore, I am initiating T4 by updating the aitutor's system prompt to reflect this specific need. This ensures that the team has a shared understanding of the TAS definitions and prompt engineering principles before moving forward with embedding generation (T5) and baseline similarity (T6)."}
