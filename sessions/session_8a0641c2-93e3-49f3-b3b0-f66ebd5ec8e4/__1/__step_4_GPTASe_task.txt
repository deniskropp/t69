The overall goal is: 'Create a self-updating system that tracks and analyzes semantic drift between Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) using embeddings. The system should record TAS text, role context, and timestamp, generate embeddings (e.g., with `text-embedding-3-large`), and measure similarity over time to detect conceptual or linguistic drift in evolving AI/human workflows.'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Identify and extract each 'Task Agnostic Step' (TAS) towards the high-level goal.'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Generate embeddings for the initial set of TAS extracted in T1 using a specified model (e.g., 'text-embedding-3-large'). Record TAS text, role context, and timestamp.'
