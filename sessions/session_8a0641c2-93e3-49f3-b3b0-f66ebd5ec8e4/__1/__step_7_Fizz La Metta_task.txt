The overall goal is: 'Create a self-updating system that tracks and analyzes semantic drift between Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) using embeddings. The system should record TAS text, role context, and timestamp, generate embeddings (e.g., with `text-embedding-3-large`), and measure similarity over time to detect conceptual or linguistic drift in evolving AI/human workflows.'

Your role's specific goal is: 'Meta-temporal coordination of layered cognition processing'
Your specific sub-task is: 'Coordinate the next iteration of TAS extraction and embedding generation, incorporating refinements from T7. Ensure the system is prepared for ongoing updates and analysis.'

I have reviewed the outputs from T1 (initial TAS extraction) and T2 (initial prompt engineering), as well as the subsequent coordination and tutoring steps. The initial TAS extraction by GPTASe (T1) provides a good foundation, but its prompt can be more explicit about the role-independent nature and the dual responsibility of embedding generation. Lyra's prompt (T2) is functional but can be sharpened to emphasize iterative refinement and efficiency, aligning with the focus of this sub-task (T7).
