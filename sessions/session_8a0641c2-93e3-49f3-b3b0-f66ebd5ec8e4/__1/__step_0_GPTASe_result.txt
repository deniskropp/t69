(e.g., 'Create a self-updating system that tracks and analyzes semantic drift between Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS) using embeddings.')\n2.  **Identify and Extract TAS**: Recognize and isolate distinct, fundamental actions from a given workflow or goal description, independent of specific roles or contexts.\n3.  **Record TAS Details**: Store the extracted TAS text, associated role context (if applicable), and a timestamp for each identified step.\n4.  **Generate Embeddings**: Convert the recorded TAS text into numerical vector representations using a specified embedding model (e.g., 'text-embedding-3-large').\n5.  **Establish Baseline Similarity**: Calculate and record the semantic similarity between the initial set of TAS embeddings to create a reference point.\n6.  **Monitor for Semantic Drift**: Periodically compare new TAS embeddings against the established baseline to detect significant changes in meaning or concept.\n7.  **Analyze Drift Patterns**: Investigate the nature and extent of detected semantic drift, identifying potential causes (e.g., conceptual evolution, linguistic shifts).\n8.  **Update System State**: Incorporate new TAS, their embeddings, and analysis results into the system's ongoing record.\n9.  **Refine Extraction Criteria**: Adjust the process or guidelines for identifying and extracting TAS based on analysis and observed drift.\n10. **Refine Embedding Model/Parameters**: Evaluate and potentially update the embedding model or its configuration for improved drift detection.\n11. **Report Drift Analysis**: Summarize findings on semantic drift, including trends, anomalies, and implications for the workflows being tracked."}]},"team":null,"reasoning":null}
